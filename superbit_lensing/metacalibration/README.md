This directory contains scripts to perform gaussian mixture modeling to galaxy shapes (`ngmix`) and
shear calibration (`metacalibration`). For a discussion of these algorithms, see 
https://github.com/esheldon/ngmix/wiki

Most of what you would need is in `mcal-scripts/`; `mcal-checkplots` is just checkplots.

Note that for these scripts to run, you will need to have the `ngmix` and `meds` python modules
installed. See:

https://github.com/esheldon/meds

and
