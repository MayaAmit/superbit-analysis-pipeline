This directory contains csv and "fiat" (a commented-header ascii format) format files that are the result of applying the above ngmix/metacal scripts to different MEDS files.

The ``one_image_tests`` directory contains the results of running metacal on the meds files generated with only one simulated observation (this was a check).
