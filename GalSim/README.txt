This directory contains the GalSim scripts used to generate the simulated superbit images used for medsmaking & ngmix/metacalibration 

debug3.py is the script that actually invokes GalSim; as written, it expects a directory of real A2218 PSFs even though it never actually uses them. That will be rewritten soon. ``debug3.py`` also expects to find the COSMOS_23.5_training_sample/ catalogs
in a data/ directory at the same level as ``debug3.py``

output-debug is the result of running debug3.py; it presently contains 5 simulated observations as well as the GalSim truth
table associated with those simulated images
